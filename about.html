            I am Chris Karcher, and I am a recent graduate from Edinboro University of Pennsylvania.
			My degree is in computer science with a focus on web development, but I also have an interest in game and virtual world development.
			I am currently a warehouse worker for a local auto parts store, but on the side, I also develop websites for my employer.
			In my spare time, I like to read, code, and play video games.
